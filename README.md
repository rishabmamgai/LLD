# Creational Design Patterns


## Factory

***Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.***

1. The main idea is to defer the logic of instantiation to subclasses.
2. This helps in hiding the logic behind creation of object from the client.

## Abstract Factory

***Helps in creating families of related objects without specifying the concrete classes.***

## Builder

***Helps to construct complex objects step by step.***

1. Selectively set fields of an object while instantiation.
2. Reduces need for multiple constructors based on number of fields.

# Behavioural Design Patterns


## Strategy

***Defines family or classes (Strategies) of algorithms and encapsulates their behaviour.***

1. Provides modularity and reusability of specific behaviours to be used by client.
2. Enables client to switch between required strategies at runtime.
